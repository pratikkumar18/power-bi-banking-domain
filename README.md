# 🏦 Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into customer behavior, loan distribution, and deposit trends using interactive Power BI dashboards. The primary goal is to help banking institutions **minimize risk in lending** decisions and better understand customer engagement.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Develop a basic understanding of **risk analytics in banking**, using data to support decisions around loan approvals. The dashboard helps answer key questions like:

- Is the customer likely to repay the loan?
- Which clients are most engaged?
- What segments contribute the most in terms of deposits or loans?

---

## 🗃️ About the Dataset
The dataset is a simulated banking database containing interlinked tables with client and bank information:

- `Banking Relationship`  
- `Client-Banking`  
- `Investment Advisor`  
- `Gender`  
- `Period`

Each table is connected using **primary and foreign keys**. The key metrics focus on customer deposits, loan distribution, and engagement.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
Performed using Power Query:

- Created new columns such as:
  - **Engagement Days** (DATEDIFF between Join Date and Today)
  - **Income Band** (Binning Estimated Income)
  - **Processing Fees** based on Fee Structure
- Established relationships between tables using keys
- Applied calculated columns and measures for KPIs

---

## 🔣 DAX Functions Used
- `SUM`, `SUMX` – for aggregations  
- `DISTINCTCOUNT` – for client count  
- `DATEDIFF` – for engagement calculation  
- `SWITCH` – for fee band logic

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- **Total Clients**  
- **Total Loan** = Bank Loan + Business Lending + Credit Card Balance  
- **Total Deposits** = Bank + Savings + Foreign Currency + Checking  
- **Engagement Length (Days)**  
- **Total Fees** (calculated using SUMX)

---

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations
- **Loan Analysis Dashboard**  
- **Deposit Overview Dashboard**  
- **Engagement & Fees Summary Dashboard**  
- **Total Bank Exposure & Income Band Metrics**

---

## ✅ Results & Insights
- Identified high-loan clients segmented by gender, advisor, and nationality  
- Highlighted clients with the highest deposit volumes  
- Showed that **private banks have more active clients**, influencing strategic decisions  
- Mapped engagement patterns based on duration of relationship with the bank

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integrate predictive models to classify high-risk borrowers  
- Include a real-time alerting system for high engagement drop-offs  
- Expand the dashboard to include cross-selling metrics and advisor performance

---

## 📎 Files Included
- `Banking_Report.pbix` (Power BI file)  
- `Dataset/` folder with all cleaned Excel sheets  
- `Documentation.pdf` (project summary + screenshots)
