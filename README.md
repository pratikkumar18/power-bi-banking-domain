ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Banks process thousands of loan applications every month, but critical insights such as portfolio health, repayment efficiency, borrower risk, and lending trends are often fragmented across multiple systems.

This lack of integration creates three major challenges:

Portfolio Monitoring: Management cannot easily track how many loans are performing (Good Loans) vs. defaulting (Bad Loans).

Repayment Efficiency: There is limited visibility into how much of the funded loan amount has been received back, leading to cash flow blind spots.

Risk Segmentation: Borrower-level attributes like employment length, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), loan purpose, and home ownership are not consistently analyzed to identify high-risk groups.

The absence of a unified BI solution makes it difficult for banks to:

Detect default risks early.

Adjust credit policies based on borrower profiles.

Understand regional or demographic patterns in lending.

Present clear insights to executives for decision-making.

âœ… Answer Using the Dashboard

To solve this, I designed an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution integrating SQL Server, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to analyze 38.6K loan applications worth $435M+. The workflow included data cleaning and validation (SQL), KPI extraction, cross-verification (Excel & Tableau), and dashboard storytelling (Power BI).

ðŸ”¹ Dashboards Designed

1. Summary Dashboard

Showed portfolio KPIs: Total Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Avg Interest Rate, Avg DTI.

Tracked Good vs Bad Loans â†’ revealed 86% performing loans vs 14% defaults.

Included a Loan Status Grid and YoY Growth trends for portfolio health.

2. Overview Dashboard

Monthly lending trends (seasonality).

Regional analysis by U.S. state â†’ flagged high delinquency states.

Borrower profiles segmented by loan purpose, home ownership, and employment length.

3. Details Dashboard

A searchable grid with borrower-level loan data.

Designed for analysts and loan officers to drill down into specific cases.

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights & Outcomes

Portfolio Quality: Out of $435M loans, 86% were Good Loans, 14% Bad Loans â†’ highlighting credit risk exposure.

Repayment Gaps: Amount received lagged behind funded loans, flagging potential cash flow issues.

High-Risk Segments: Borrowers with high DTI ratios and short employment history showed higher default tendencies.

Regional Patterns: Certain states had a concentration of defaults â†’ enabling geography-specific policy changes.

Loan Purpose Impact: Debt consolidation & credit card repayment loans contributed most to bad loans.

ðŸ”¹ Business Impact

Enabled leadership to tighten lending criteria for high-risk borrower groups.

Helped optimize monitoring efforts by focusing on risky states and borrower segments.

Delivered clear, presentation-ready insights for executives via Power BI dashboards and an executive PPT.
