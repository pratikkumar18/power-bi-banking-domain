# ðŸ“Š Bank Loan BI & Analytics Solution  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  

Banks process thousands of loan applications every month, but critical insights such as **portfolio health, repayment efficiency, borrower risk, and lending trends** are often fragmented across multiple systems.  

This creates three major challenges:  

1. **Portfolio Monitoring** â€“ Difficulty in tracking performing loans (**Good Loans**) vs. defaults (**Bad Loans**).  
2. **Repayment Efficiency** â€“ Limited visibility into repayments vs. disbursements, creating **cash flow blind spots**.  
3. **Risk Segmentation** â€“ Borrower attributes like **employment length, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), loan purpose, and home ownership** are not consistently analyzed to identify high-risk groups.  

Without a unified BI solution, banks struggle to:  
- Detect **default risks early**  
- Adjust **credit policies** to reduce exposure  
- Identify **regional/demographic patterns**  
- Provide **clear insights for leadership decisions**
